	  - 1. Preemptively warm up the fonts’ origin.
	  -
	  - 2. Initiate a high-priority, asynchronous fetch for the CSS file. Works in
	  -    most modern browsers.
	  -
	  - 3. Initiate a low-priority, asynchronous fetch that gets applied to the page
	  -    only after it’s arrived. Works in all browsers with JavaScript enabled.
	  -
	  - 4. In the unlikely event that a visitor has intentionally disabled
	  -    JavaScript, fall back to the original method. The good news is that,
	  -    although this is a render-blocking request, it can still make use of the
	  -    preconnect which makes it marginally faster than the default.

      This document is designed to provide higher education leaders with an analysis of the leading commercial players strategies in this domain, the implications of those strategies, and a preliminary set of possible broad stroke strategies that higher education institutions might consider taking to secure outcomes consistent with their own values and goals.

    <h2>
      <a href="https://josephmcarthur.github.io/infrastructure/landscape-analysis/summary">The Dutch Consortia/Elsevier Contract: The Real Risks</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In December, SPARC assessed an institutional agreement that a Dutch national academic consortia and Elsevier were in the process of negotiating. At the time, we were responding to leaks in the press, which were largely confirmed by the subsequent release of the terms of a framework agreement between the Dutch consortia and the publisher. Last week, the parties announced the official terms of the agreement.

    </h2>
     <p>
       An important area when institutions can assert control of data is through purchasing and procurement processes. These processes should be revisited and revised to ensure that they are transparent, competitive, and fully coordinated across the institution.
