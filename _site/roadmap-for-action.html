	  - 1. Preemptively warm up the fonts’ origin.
	  -
	  - 2. Initiate a high-priority, asynchronous fetch for the CSS file. Works in
	  -    most modern browsers.
	  -
	  - 3. Initiate a low-priority, asynchronous fetch that gets applied to the page
	  -    only after it’s arrived. Works in all browsers with JavaScript enabled.
	  -
	  - 4. In the unlikely event that a visitor has intentionally disabled
	  -    JavaScript, fall back to the original method. The good news is that,
	  -    although this is a render-blocking request, it can still make use of the
	  -    preconnect which makes it marginally faster than the default.

    An important area when institutions can assert control of data is through purchasing and procurement processes. These processes should be revisited and revised to ensure that they are transparent, competitive, and fully coordinated across the institution.

    The second category of actions is more complex, since it relates to decisions that will need to be made specifically based on each individual institution’s mission, culture and values. It also involves the establishment of an explicit process to determine the position that each institution wants to take in regards to specific issues posed by the collection of data and the deployment of data analytics tools.
