		GET FONTS AND GET THEM FAST.

	  - 1. Preemptively warm up the fonts’ origin.
	  -
	  - 2. Initiate a high-priority, asynchronous fetch for the CSS file. Works in
	  -    most modern browsers.
	  -
	  - 3. Initiate a low-priority, asynchronous fetch that gets applied to the page
	  -    only after it’s arrived. Works in all browsers with JavaScript enabled.
	  -
	  - 4. In the unlikely event that a visitor has intentionally disabled
	  -    JavaScript, fall back to the original method. The good news is that,
	  -    although this is a render-blocking request, it can still make use of the
	  -    preconnect which makes it marginally faster than the default.

  <h1>Claudio</h1>
    <p>
      Claudio Aspesi, a respected market analyst with more than a decade of experience covering the academic publishing market for international investors. Between 2004 and 2016, Aspesi was the Senior Research Analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein covering European Media Stocks. The academic publishing market – and Reed Elsevier and Pearson in specific – was a key area focus for him during his tenure. Previously he was Global Senior Vice President of Strategy at EMI Music and was responsible for defining EMI’s business model as the music industry entered the digital age. Before joining EMI in 2002, Claudio was a member of the executive team at Airclic, an Internet infrastructure company and, prior to that, a partner at McKinsey and Co., working with many leading media and entertainment companies.

<h1>SPARC</h1>
    <p>
      SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) works to enable the open sharing of research outputs and educational materials in order to democratize access to knowledge, accelerate discovery, and increase the return on our investment in research and education. As a catalyst for action, SPARC focuses on collaborating with other stakeholders—including authors, publishers, libraries, students, funders, policymakers and the public—to build on the opportunities created by the Internet, promoting changes to both infrastructure and culture needed to make open the default for research and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to SPARC’s success is the commitment of our members to support and shape our initiatives. Our 240+ members are primarily academic and research libraries located in the U.S. and Canada, who use the resources and support provided by SPARC to actively promote Open Access to scholarly articles, the open sharing of research data, and the creation and adoption of Open Educational Resources on their campuses.

    We produced this comprehensive analysis after conducting interviews with dozens of key stakeholders including provosts, CIO’s, library leaders, students, and higher education administrators in a wide variety of North American institutions, as well as publishers, and other market experts.
