The goal of this document is to describe the current landscape of publishers moving into core activities of universities. Actively formulating and implementing solutions to these problems is complex but critically important, and something SPARC intends to work closely with the community on. However, we think it is worthwhile to conclude this document with a recap of some of the options for action currently available to the academic community.

In general, we think that solutions must be tailored to individual colleges or universities, although some of them would likely require a significant number of institutions to work together. For any institutional context, the key drivers will be a mix of cultural elements (how centralized or decentralized are decisions? What is the appetite for establishing deep ties to commercial vendors?) and financial considerations (what are the spending priorities? What magnitude of savings does leadership hope to get from the deployment of data analytics? Would targeting significant revenues from IP represent an acceptable decision? What kind of companies are off-limits to partnerships because of their activities?) We aim to offer a menu of choices and illustrations of best practices, rather than prescribing a single course of action. That said, we think that there are two different sets of solutions.

**Risk Mitigation** 

We think of the first set as risk mitigation solutions. These are actions aimed at protecting colleges and universities from the unintended consequences of deploying a rising number of data analytic tools and collecting larger and more intrusive amounts and categories of data.
